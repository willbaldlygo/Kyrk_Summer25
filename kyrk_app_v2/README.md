# Kyrk – Race Results Q&A (v2)

This version has upgraded prompting so that:

* Winner / podium questions without a gender **return both male and female winners**.
* Count questions like “How many women finished each year?” always list **every year**, not a single total.

See `app.py` for the updated `system_prompt`.

Deployment steps remain identical to v1.
